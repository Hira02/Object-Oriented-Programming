Definition: The singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class
 to one "single" instance.
You are not allowed to create even a second instance of the class.
Constructor is static here and also private.
Use case:
When your code is accessing DB, creating single instace is better. 
In logging system.

NOT RECOMMENDED to use in general cases. If you create a single instance of your class and your code is very huge
then debugging is difficult, even unit testing makes harder.

RECOMMENDED: You may create one instance of your class, but you should not be restricted to create only one.
